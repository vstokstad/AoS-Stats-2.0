# DiceHammer
## Warhammer Age Of Sigmar Dice app with peer-to-peer connectivity.

DiceHammer was developed as a side project to explore networking and iOS development in a warhammer-themed way.
The app lets you connect to another nearby person with the app, if both are accepting the connection you can then play a game of warhammer by rolling dice digitally and the result of each diceroll will be sent as a notification to your opponent, so both players have a way of seeing what is rolled.
Extra features include a simple Stat viewer, where you can see a certain warscrolls (model or type of unit) probability to harm another unit.

Developed from scratch using Swift and SwiftUI.
